## Introduction

The What's For Dinner application helps users choose a recipe to make for dinner.  The options available include choosing a side, main course, dessert or entire meal. 

This application is based on the project spec provided by Turing School of Software and Design.  The spec for this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/dinner.html). 

## Learning Goals

- Gain experience building an application that utilizes HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Write HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
- Understand how to listen to and respond to user events
- Individualize my programming skill set

## Setup

- Fork this project to your own Github account
- Clone the repository to your local machine
- `cd` into the project
- Read this README thoroughly, then begin working!

## Technologies

As mentioned in the Learning Goals, I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to prepare this application.  To view the deployed application, please visit [https://rachel-bock.github.io/whats-for-dinner/](https://rachel-bock.github.io/whats-for-dinner/).

Below are some images of the project showing how the user can select either an individual menu option or the entire meal option.

## Ideas for Future Features/Fixes

Additional functionality that could extend the usefulness of this application include the following:

- Have an individual account login
- Save and remove favorites
- Error handling and a clear button to clear the screen
- Add recipes to the application's data model
- Making each dish appear once before repeating dishes
